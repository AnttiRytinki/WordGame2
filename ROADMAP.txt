Will create Solo Mode, Versus AI Mode, Hot Seat Mode and Online Mode

Will add score equation for solo mode.
Solo mode will work as follows:
In phase 1, player types words as usual, where words are of max length 10.
In phase 2, player has to find all the words as fast as possible.
Score equation will be K/(C*T) where K is some constant to be determined,
C is the number of button clicks made,
and T is the time in milliseconds it took for the player to find all the words.

Will add scrabble points for the letters?

Create defaults.cfg which says what your preferred defaults are.
If on game start, defaults don't match the opponents, a prompt and chat is displayed for both players
so you can agree on starting conditions for enabling commands, minigames and cheats.

In the future a separate server will be made which displays open game lobbies and these settings for each server.

Local settings will include "Allow Audio" flag.

Commands all start with %

%wait(seconds) whereby the app displays the circle loading thingy for that amount of time for both players.
%donate whereby the app pops up my donation link.
%machinegun whereby gun sound effects are added to keypress down and release.
---DONE %NATO whereby the app plays NATO alphabet wav file upon key press.
%drums whereby the numpad becomes a drum machine.
%typewriter whereby the app sounds like a type writer.
%grog(volume1, percent1, volume2, percent2, ...) whereby the app calculates the alcohol percent of your grog.
%applause whereby the app plays applause.wav for both players.

Minigames (or rather, game continuations) that start with #

#tictactoe whereby the app expands to 30x30 where the center square is your original game,
Players fight in the squares to put X or O,
When board has been fully revealed.

#robovacuum whereby the app places a smart robotic vacuum cleaner in your fully revealed board

Cheats all start with /

To enable cheats one player types /sv_cheats 1 whereby second player gets prompt whether to enable cheats.
You can only ask once each game.
Some cheats are valid only in phase 1 and some only in phase 2 and some in both.

/jesus whereby the app places "water" or "wine" in the grid.
/paradox whereby the app puts a random paradox in the grid.
/unreveal(x,y) [self explanatory]
/story whereby the app takes "once", "upon", "a" and "time" and places them in the grid. Max one usage.
---UNDER DEVELOPMENT /glass whereby the app takes "half" and "full" or "empty" and places them in the grid.
/random whereby the app suggests a word from random.txt.
/morsecode whereby the app is replaced with a button which acts as beeper, and transmits to opponent.
/switch whereby the app switches green to represent the opposite color of horizontal or vertical.

/quote(name) will pick a random line from name.txt and place in the grid. Like:

/quote(southpark)
/quote(simpsons)
/quote(familyguy)
/quote(lotr)			// Lord Of The Rings
