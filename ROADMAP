Will add cheatcodes that all start with /

First one will be /pythagoras whereby the app reduces the grid to a random triangle and the players quickly have to respond with the length of the hypothenuse.
Next one will be /tetris whereby the app becomes tetris and it plays the melody notes one by one as the players play tetris with the words.
Third one will be /ai whereby the app suggests synonyms all the time.
Fourth one will be /wait(milliseconds) whereby the app displays the circle loading thingy for that amount of time for both players.
Fifth one will be /censorship whereby the app allows both players to use the arrow keys to guide the censorship...
Sixth one will be /hitler whereby the app plays a random hitler audio sample.
Seventh one will be /paradox whereby the app puts a random paradox in the grid.
Eighth one will be /insanity whereby the app scrambles letters. And doesn't stop. And becomes unresponsive.
Ninth one will be /discoball whereby the buttons clearly are influenced by a disco ball.
Tenth one will be /fire (countered by /extinguisher)
Eleventh one will be /unreveal(x,y)
Twelwth one will be /story whereby the app takes "once", "upon", "a" and "time" and places them in the grid.
---UNDER DEVELOPMENT Thirteenth one will be /glass whereby the app takes "half" and "full" or "empty" and places them in the grid.
Fourteenth one will be /app
Fifteenth one will be /random
Sixteenth one will be /pinball
